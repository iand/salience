# Contributing

* Do submit your changes as a pull request
* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Do run `go fmt` on the code before committing 
* Do feel free to add yourself to the [`CREDITS`](CREDITS) file and the
  corresponding Contributors list in the [`README.md`](README.md). 
  Alphabetical order applies.
* Don't touch the [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS) file. An existing author will add you if 
  your contributions are significant enough.
* Do note that in order for any non-trivial changes to be merged (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), an explicit
  Public Domain Dedication needs to be on record from you. Please include
  a copy of the statement found in the [`WAIVER`](WAIVER) file with your pull request
